This is your Wiki. It will help you to keep an eye on important things happening in your social intranet.

Connect and discuss with others
Build your network by connecting with colleagues in Connections. They will be able to follow, comment or like all the ideas, moods, status updates, links or documents that you share above. Let the discussion start!

Discover the power of social collaboration
You can do a lot of useful things with Documents, Wikis, Forums and Calendars applications. Important things you do with them will be summarised automatically in the activity stream with just the right level of information to keep you and your network updated.

Use spaces for team or project matters
Create or join collaboration Spaces for your teams, projects or communities. Spaces are ideal places for collaborating on specific topics. All activity happening in your spaces is also available in the activity stream.

Anywhere at anytime\\
