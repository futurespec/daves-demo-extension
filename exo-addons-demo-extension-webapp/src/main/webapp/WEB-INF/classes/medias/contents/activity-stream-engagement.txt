= Rationale =

Since the activity stream is the main content of the homepage, we don't want users to start with it empty. When a new user arrives on home, instead of seeing an empty activity stream we display starting content  to engage him using it.

= Composer Hint Block =

When user has an empty activity stream we display a hint below the composer to tell him what it's for.

|=ID|=Description
| COMPOSER_HINT_01 | When the activity stream is empty, a dismissible hint block is displayed below the activity composer. As soon as the activity stream contains activities, the hint block does not appear anymore for this user.
| COMPOSER_HINT_02 | The hint text is : //This is the main place to share documents, links, ideas and updates about what you are working on.//
| COMPOSER_HINT_03 | a small cross allows to dismiss the hint block temporary, but this change is not persistent and the bubble will reappear on a page refresh as long as there is no activities in the stream.

= Welcome Activity =

A fake activity welcomes the user in his new intranet and gives him a very quick overview of what he can do with it.


| WELCOME_ACTIVITY_01| A welcome activity appears as long as there are no activities in the stream. When activities are in the stream, it is not displayed anymore.
| WELCOME_ACTIVITY_02| Author field of the fake activity  is used to display this label : //Welcome to your new Social Intranet!//
| WELCOME_ACTIVITY_03| Avatar of the fake activity is  the generic user avatar
| WELCOME_ACTIVITY_04| Date field displayed is always : //less than a minute ago//
| WELCOME_ACTIVITY_05| Featured Content of the fake activity is :(((

This is your activity stream.  It will help you to keep an eye on important things happening in your social intranet.

**Connect and discuss with others**
Build your network by connecting with colleagues in [[Connections>>/portal/intranet/connexions]]. They will be able to follow, comment or like all the ideas, moods, status updates, links or documents that you share above. Let the discussion start!

**Discover the power of social collaboration**
You can do a lot of useful things with [[Documents>>/portal/intranet/documents]],  [[Wiki>>/portal/intranet/wiki]], [[Forums>>/portal/intranet/forum]] and [[Calendars>>/portal/intranet/calendar]]  applications. Important things you do with them will be summarised automatically in the activity stream with just the right level of information to keep you and your network updated. 

**Use spaces for team or project matters**
Create or join collaboration  [[Spaces>>/portal/intranet/all-spaces]]for your teams, projects or communities. Spaces are ideal places for collaborating on specific topics.
All activity happening in your spaces is also available in the activity stream.

**Anywhere at anytime**
Download mobile applications from the [[iOS App Store>>https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/exo-platform-3.5/id410476273?mt=8]] and [[Google Play>>https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.exoplatform]]. With your mobile device, you can also check the activity stream.
